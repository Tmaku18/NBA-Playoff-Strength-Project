# Use with outputs8 / Spearman-surrogate training (branch: feature/train-spearman-surrogate).
# Merge with defaults_playoff_outcome + sweep config. Model A trains with differentiable Spearman surrogate loss.
#
# Example: python -m scripts.run_pipeline_from_model_a --config config/outputs8_train_spearman_surrogate.yaml --outputs outputs8/phase_1/outcome/best_spearman
# (Merge with defaults: use config that already sets listmle_target and paths; this file only sets loss_type.)

paths:
  outputs: "outputs8"

training:
  listmle_target: "playoff_outcome"
  loss_type: "spearman_surrogate"
  loss_tau: 1.0
